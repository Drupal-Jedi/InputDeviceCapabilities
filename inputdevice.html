        This proposal was produced in collaboration with members of the W3C
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/">Web Applications Working Group</a>,
        the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/pointerevents/">Pointer Events Working Group</a>
        and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/touchevents/">Touch Events Community Group</a>.
        It is my hope that the work here will ultimately be integrated into the [[UIEvents]] specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although there is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WLadG2dn4vlCewOmUtUEoRsThiptC7Ox28CRmYUn8Uw/edit#">
        wide variety of properties</a> which would be valuable to add here, for now
        this document aims to define only those that are strongly justified as solving
        important real-world problems.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        DOM input events are an abstraction above low-level input events, only loosely
        tied to physical device input (e.g. ‘click’ events can be fired by a mouse,
        touchscreen or keyboard).  There is no mechanism to obtain
        lower-level details about the physical device responsible for an event.
        This leads to problems, as developers may need to make
        assumptions or rely on heuristics.  For example, when supporting both mouse and
        touch input, it's difficult to know whether a mousedown event represents
        new input from a mouse, or a compatibility event for a previously processed touchstart event.
      </p>
      <p>
        The InputDevice API is designed to provide additional details about the underlying
        source of an input event.  To avoid reliance on faulty assumptions (which may be
        violated by edge cases or future input devices), this API attempts to describe how
        a device behaves (e.g. whether it fires touch events), not what it is
        (e.g. a touchscreen).
      </p>
    </section>
    <section dfn-for="InputDevice">
      <h2>The <code>InputDevice</code> interface</h2>
      <p>
        An <dfn>InputDevice</dfn> represents an input device (or group of related devices)
        capable of generating input events.  Events caused by the same physical input device
        will get the same <code>sourceDevice</code> object, but the converse isn't necessarily true.
        E.g. two mice with the same properties in a system may appear as a single
        <code>InputDevice</code> instance.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        In some cases an <code>InputDevice</code> will represent a logical device rather
        than a physical input device.  For example, in some environments keyboard events
        are generated by tapping on an on-screen keyboard on a touchscreen.  In such a
        scenario the <code>InputDevice</code> represents the properties of the virtual keyboard
        (since that's really what matters to authors), not the properties of the physical
        touchscreen device (which should be considered an implementation detail of the logical
        keyboard device).
      </p>
      <pre class="idl">
        [Constructor(optional InputDeviceInit deviceInitDict)]
        interface InputDevice {
          readonly attribute boolean firesTouchEvents;
        };

        dictionary InputDeviceInit {
          boolean firesTouchEvents = false;
        };
      </pre>
      <section>
        <h3><code>InputDevice</code> attributes</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>firesTouchEvents</dfn></dt>
          <dd>          
            Indicates whether this device dispatches [[Touch-Events]].
            <div class="note">
              This doesn't necessarily mean the device is a touch screen.  For example,
              stylus and mouse devices typically generate touch events on mobile browsers.
              This property can be used to detect mouse events [[UIEvents]] which represent
              an action that may have already been handled by touch event handlers.  See
              <a href="#example_1">Example 1</a> for details.

      <h2>Extensions to the <code>UIEvent</code> interface and <code>UIEventInit</code> dictionary</h2>
      <p><code>UIEvent</code> and <code>UIEventInit</code> are defined in [[!UIEvents]].</p>
      <pre class="idl">
        partial interface UIEvent {
          readonly attribute InputDevice? sourceDevice;
        };

        partial dictionary UIEventInit {
          InputDevice? sourceDevice = null;
        };
      </pre>
      <dl dfn-for="UIEvent">
        <dt><dfn>sourceDevice</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          Indicates the <a>InputDevice</a> responsible for the generation
          of this event, or <code>null</code> if no input device was responsible.
          <div class="note">
            The exact semantics of when a device is "resposible" for an event depends
            somewhat on host OS properties and so is implementation-defined.  For example,
            although a mouse or keyboard may be used to resize a window, this detail is
            not exposed to the web platform in any way and so the <code>sourceDevice</code>
            of a <code>resize</code> event will typically be <code>null</code>.

myButton.addEventListener('touchend', function(e) {

  // tap detection to actually trigger the button.
  myButton.classList.remove("pressed");
});

myButton.addEventListener('touchcancel',  {
  myButton.classList.remove("pressed");
});

myButton.addEventListener('mousedown', function(e) {
  // Touch event case handled above, don't change the style again on tap.
  if (!e.sourceDevice.firesTouchEvents)

      <h2>Relationship to APIs in other platforms</h2>
      <section><h3>Windows 8</h3>
        <p>Windows Runtime has a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.devices.input.pointerdevice.aspx">PointerDevice class</a>,
        which is correlated to a pointer input event via <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.input.pointerpoint.pointerdevice.aspx">Windows.UI.Input.PointerPoint.PointerDevice</a>.
        Additional information is available from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.devices.input.mousecapabilities.aspx">MouseCapabilities</a>,

      <section><h3>Mac OS X</h3>
        <p>MacOS X has various properties directly on NSEvent for determining device details.
